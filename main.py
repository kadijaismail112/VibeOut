VibeOut: A Python3 script to give a quote that matches the weather and mood of the user.
Given a location, the script will use the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather and then
prompt the user for their mood. The script will then use the mood and weather to find a
quote that matches the user's mood and the weather.
